## Plot

Cloud woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an eggs he left for school.
Normally Cloud would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Cloud specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly. The zoo keeper catches him and asks what he was doing. Cloud said explained he usually cuts by the zoo to get to school. Then the zoo keeper lets Cloud on his way.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance. 
Cloud had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephantâ€™s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Cloud would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and Chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.
As he carefully treaded through the ferns, he started to notice some peculiar things. The air was sweet like glaze on a freshly made doughnut, he felt lighter, as if he could jump to the moon. He looked back, not able to see the door as it's now covered in ferns. As he pushes forwards, there's less and less ferns, and eventually he sees something. He sees a Unicorn, and as he pushed forward he blacks out.

Cloud wakes up, at home to his mom screaming why he missed school today. He doesn't know if it was a dream or real.
He stands up, and notices things around him are floating. He pinches himself.
This is real.
The end.
